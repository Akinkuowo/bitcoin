                        <h5><strong>5. THE WALLET</strong></h5>
                        <h6>5.1 Description</h6>
                        <p><b>5.1.1</b>  The Wallet (also known as the “Private Key Wallet”) is provided to you exclusively by Blockchain Luxembourg S.A. The Wallet is only capable of supporting certain Virtual Currencies. Under no circumstances should you attempt to store Virtual Currencies in your Wallet that the Wallet does not support.</p>
                        <p><b>5.1.2</b>  When you create a Wallet, the Wallet software generates a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive any supported Virtual Currency via the relevant Virtual Currency network. YOU MUST STORE, OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES, A BACKUP OF ALL WALLET CREDENTIALS, INCLUDING YOUR PASSPHRASES, IDENTIFIERS, BACKUP PHRASES, PRIVATE KEYS AND NETWORK ADDRESSES. If you do not maintain a backup of your Wallet data outside of the Services, you will not be able to access Virtual Currency previously accessed using your Wallet in the event that we discontinue or no longer offer some or all of the Services or may otherwise lose access to Virtual Currency. We are not responsible for maintaining this data on your behalf.</p>
                        <h6><b>5.2.</b> Trading Account 5.2.1 General</h6>
                        <p>Any Virtual Currency you purchase using fiat currency in the Wallet will be held in the Trading Account. All Virtual Currency held in your Trading Account will be held on trust by Trading.com for your benefit on a custodial basis. Among other things, this means that:</p>
                        <p>(a)  Title to the Virtual Currency shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to any company in the Blockchain Vaulta Group. As the owner of Virtual Currency in your Trading Account, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Virtual Currency. Blockchain Vaulta shall not have any liability for fluctuations in the fiat currency value of Virtual Currency held in your Trading Account.</p>
                        <p>(b)  None of the Virtual Currencies in your Trading Account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, Blockchain.com; Blockchain Vaulta does not represent or treat assets in a user’s Trading Account as belonging to Blockchain.com. Blockchain Vaulta may not grant a security interest in the Virtual Currency held in your Trading Account. Except as required by a facially valid court order, or except as provided herein, Blockchain Vaulta will not sell, transfer, loan, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise alienate Virtual Currency in your Trading Account unless instructed by you or compelled by a court of competent jurisdiction to do so.</p>
                        <p>(c)  You control the Virtual Currency held in your Trading Account. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your Virtual Currency by sending it to a different blockchain address controlled by you or a third party. In the event you wish to transfer Virtual Currency into the Wallet, you may be prompted to set up a backup phrase in order to do so.</p>
                        <p>(d)  In order to more securely custody assets, Blockchain Vaulta may use shared blockchain addresses, controlled by a member of the Blockchain Vaulta Group, to hold Virtual Currencies held on behalf of customers and/or held on behalf of Blockchain.com. Your Virtual Currency is segregated from the Blockchain Vaulta Group’s own Virtual Currency by way of separate ledger accounting entries for customer and Blockchain Vaulta Group accounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, although we maintain separate ledger accounting entries for customer and Blockchain Vaulta accounts, no member of the Blockchain Vaulta Group shall have any obligation to segregate by blockchain address Virtual Currencies owned by you from Virtual Currencies owned by other customers or by any member of the Blockchain Vaulta Group.</p>
                        <p>(e)  We may store any Virtual Currency you deposit for use on Blockchain Vaulta Exchange in a “hot wallet”, “cold wallet” or other storage method in our sole discretion.</p>
                        <p>The Trading Account will be exclusively provided by Blockchain Vaulta for all non-US users and Blockchain.com, Inc. for US-based users.</p>
                        <p><b>5.2.2  Minimum Holding Periods</b></p>
                        <p>When you place purchase orders in the Trading Account, we may impose minimum holding periods in respect of any Virtual Currency that you have purchased which may last up to a maximum of 7 days. These minimum holding periods are necessary to enable us to carry out effective fraud prevention measures and to ensure that the fiat currency leg of any given transaction has settled. After this minimum holding period elapses, you may trade your Virtual Currency in the ordinary way.</p>
                        <p><b>5.2.3  No Cancellation</b></p>
                        <p>You may not cancel, reverse or change any transaction in the Trading Account. We may suspend, delay, redirect, reverse or cancel any transaction at any time and for any reason. For example, and without limitation, we may do so if we suspect any risk of fraud, crime, breach of this User Agreement, or illicit activity. You will bear the costs of any network fees charged in respect of such suspension, delay, redirection, reversal or cancellation.</p>
                        <p><b>5.2.4  Transaction Limitation</b></p>
                        <p>We may implement transaction limits in the Trading Account. These may vary based on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the time of your transaction, your location, the Virtual Currency purchased, and the Virtual Currency sold. We implement, raise and lower transaction limits in the Trading Account in our sole discretion.</p>
                        <p><b>5.2.5  Reversals of payment instructions and/or negative balances</b></p>
                        <p>If you reverse a payment instruction initiated with your bank, payment services provider or equivalent or part of a transaction fails for any reason which results in your Trading Account having a negative balance, we may liquidate any assets held in any account you hold with us (including the User Accounts) to offset and reduce the negative balance. You remain fully responsible for settling the balance and we may engage debt collectors to pursue any outstanding debt on our behalf.</p>
                        <p><b>5.2.6 Treatment of Algos</b></p>
                        <p>When you hold Algos in your Trading Account, you will not receive any Algo staking rewards in respect of your Trading Account balance. You may receive awards in the future.</p>
                        <h6>5.3 Risk Disclosures Relating to the Wallet</h6>
                        <p><b>5.3.1</b>  In order to be completed, any Virtual Currency transaction created with the Wallet must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency ledger associated with the relevant Virtual Currency network. Such networks are decentralised, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by Blockchain.com.</p>
                        <p><b>5.3.2</b>  Blockchain Vaulta has no control over any Virtual Currency network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via our Services will be confirmed on the relevant Virtual Currency network. The transaction details you submit via our Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Virtual Currency network used to process the transaction. We do not guarantee that the Wallet can transfer title or right in any Virtual Currency or make any warranties whatsoever with regard to title.</p>
                        <p><b>5.3.3</b>  Once transaction details have been submitted to a Virtual Currency network, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. Blockchain Vaulta has no control over any Virtual Currency network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.</p>
                        <h6>5.4  Forks</h6>
                        <p>In the event of a Fork or other network disruption, Blockchain Vaulta may not be able to support activity related to your Virtual Currency. In the event of a Fork, the transactions may not be completed, completed partially, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed. Blockchain Vaulta is not responsible for any loss incurred by you caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a Fork or other network disruption.</p>
                        <h6>5.5  No Password Retrieval</h6>
                        <p><b>5.5.1</b>  With respect to the Wallet, Blockchain Vaulta does not receive or store your Wallet password, nor any keys, network addresses or transaction history.

However, we reserve the right to do so in the future, and in such case shall display to you any applicable fees prior to you incurring the fee. Network fees (including, without limitation “miner’s fees”) required to use a Virtual Currency network may apply to a transaction. We may attempt to calculate such a fee for you. Our calculation may not be sufficient, or it may be excessive. You may select a greater or lesser fee.

                        <h6>9.4.1.1  Treatment of Fiat Funds</h6>
                        <p>We shall hold fiat currency deposited by you in your User Account for your benefit and on your behalf in a third bank account. Each such account is separate from Blockchain.com’s operating bank account(s).</p>

                        <p>Any Virtual Currency held in your User Account on Blockchain Vaulta Exchange will be held by Blockchain Vaulta on trust for your benefit on a custodial basis. Among other things, this means that:
                        (a)  Title to Virtual Currency shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to any company in the Blockchain Vaulta Group. As the owner of Virtual Currency in your User Account, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Virtual Currency.

As the owner of Virtual Currency in such User Account, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Virtual Currency.

                        Virtual Currency is segregated from the Blockchain Vaulta Group’s own Virtual Currency or funds by way of separate ledger accounting entries for customer and Blockchain Vaulta Group accounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, although we maintain separate ledger accounting entries for customer and Blockchain Vaulta accounts, no member of the Blockchain Vaulta Group shall have any obligation to segregate by blockchain address Virtual Currencies owned by you from Virtual Currencies owned by other customers or by any member of the Blockchain Vaulta Group.
                        (e) We may store any Virtual Currency you deposit for use on Blockchain Vaulta Exchange in a “hot wallet”, “cold wallet” or other storage method in our sole discretion.</p>

Upon making a deposit or withdrawal request for fiat currency, you may be directed away from Blockchain Vaulta Exchange or Blockchain Vaulta Site to a third party website. In such case, you are solely responsible for any actions taken on such website and we shall not be liable for any loss resulting in whole or in part from such website or provider.</p>
                        <h6>9.4.4  Deposit and Withdrawal Limits</h6>

                        <h6>9.4.5  Reversals of payment instructions and/or negative balances</h6>
                        <p>If you reverse a payment instruction initiated with your bank, payment services provider or equivalent or part of a transaction fails for any reason which results in your User Account having a negative balance, we may liquidate any assets held in any account you hold with us (including the User Account) to offset and reduce the negative balance. You remain fully responsible for settling the balance and we may engage debt collectors to pursue any outstanding debt on our behalf.</p>

                        <h5>10 GENERAL RISK FACTORS</h5>
                        <p>Your use of the Services requires you to bear risks for which we cannot be held responsible. We list some, but not all of these risks below:
                        a) Hardware, software or connections required to interact with a Virtual Currency network might fail, succumb to malware, unauthorised access or malicious attacks.
                        Third parties may obtain unauthorised access to the Services, including, but not limited to your public and private keys. Blockchain Vaulta shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Services, however caused.
                        b)  Forks, unknown vulnerabilities in or unanticipated changes to the network protocol may cause losses to you or others. Blockchain Vaulta has no control over any cryptocurrency network and shall not be responsible for any harm occurring as a result of the inability to reverse a transaction, and any losses in connection therewith due to erroneous or fraudulent actions.
                        c)  The risk of loss of value in using Services involving Virtual Currencies may be substantial and losses may occur over a short period of time. In addition, price and liquidity are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unpredictable.
                        d)  Virtual Currencies are not legal tender and are not backed by any sovereign government. In addition, the legislative and regulatory landscape around Virtual Currencies is constantly changing and may affect your ability to use, transfer, or exchange Virtual Currencies.
                        e)  When placing a “market order” in a Virtual Currency, your order will be executed immediately at the current market price. Market orders do not carry a limit price and will trade with anything on the order book. During periods of high volume, fast market conditions, illiquidity, or volatility in the marketplace, the actual price that a market order is executed at may be different from the best price indicated at the time of your order, and in some cases significantly so.
                        f)  Under certain market conditions you may find it difficult to liquidate a position. In such circumstances, Blockchain Vaulta Exchange may not have sufficient demand to meet your request to execute such a transaction. Placing contingent orders, such as a “stop” or “limit” order does not guarantee your potential loss will be limited to an intended amount, as market conditions may make it difficult to execute such orders. You may suffer losses due to orders executing at lower or higher values than anticipated or requested.
                        g)  Virtual Currency transactions may not be reversible.

                        <h6>15.1  Disputes</h6>
                        <p>If you live in the United States (or, if you are a business, have your principal place of business in the United States), any dispute arising between you and us under this User Agreement or our relationship (whether arising out of contract, tort, statute or any other manner) shall be settled in binding arbitration, in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act under the American Arbitration Association’s rules; provided, however, nothing in this Agreement will waive, preclude or otherwise limit your right to (i) bring an individual action in a US small claims court or (ii) file a representative action solely to obtain a public injunction.</p>
                        <h6>15.2  Arbitration</h6>
                        <p>The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish of your billing address, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator shall apply the law of the state of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys' fees when authorised by law, and the arbitration decision may be enforced in any court. You agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to order relief, and you agree to abide by all decisions and awards rendered in such a proceeding, which shall be final and conclusive. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this agreement shall be entitled to reasonable costs and attorneys' fees. If the arbitrator(s) or administrator imposes filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. If a court decides that any provision of this section concerning Arbitration is invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and resolved in accordance with English law exclusively and the other parts of this section concerning Arbitration shall still apply. In no case shall the remainder of this User Agreement be affected. If the invalidity or unenforceability of a provision causes a dispute to proceed in a court instead of arbitration, the Parties agree that such court must be located in London, England, applying English law.</p>
                        <h6>15.3 No Trial by Jury</h6>
                        <p>By entering into this User Agreement, you expressly waive your right to a trial by jury and right to participate in a class action lawsuit.</p>
                        <h6>16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR NON-US USERS</h6>
                        <p>If you live outside of the United States (or, if you are a business, have your principal place of business outside of the United States), any dispute arising between you and us under this User Agreement or our relationship (whether arising out of contract, tort, statute or any other manner), the courts located in London, England shall have exclusive jurisdiction of such dispute, and will hear the dispute under English law.</p>
